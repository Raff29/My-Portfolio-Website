## About
Hi there! You can call me Raff. I'm a developer who likes to create cool stuff with code. I enjoy hiking, travelling, and playing pc games. Also, spending time with my wife and daughter is very important to me.  I love music, going to concerts, and I'm an avid fan of craft beer. In a previous life, I was an amateur BMX competitor. How cool is that? If you want to know more about me or my projects, feel free to contact me anytime.
